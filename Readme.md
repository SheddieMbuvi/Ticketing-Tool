## Ticketing Tool

### Initiated by Shadrack Mbuvi.

This tool will be customized to create, resolve and analyse all requestes directed to the IT department.

Eventually, this tool can be used to assign roles within a diverse team.

## Objectives
•	To build a scalable, role-based ticketing system that enables task tracking and management.
•	To implement task assignment capabilities, allowing designated roles (e.g., admins or team leaders) to allocate tasks to specific users or groups.
•	To enhance productivity by automating notifications and status tracking for all tasks and assigned tickets.
•	To ensure security and proper data handling through Role-Based Access Control (RBAC), allowing only authorized personnel to access sensitive data and functionalities.
•	To streamline analysis of user requests to identify pain areas and work on justifiable solutions.
